THE FIRST GAME:
MATH TRIVIA:

This is a math trivia game that allows 2 user to play together while switching off turns.

This game starts off on the home page with instructions and a button to begin playing.  Once that button is pressed, the page redirects to the main game page.
Once redirected the user is prompted to enter the player's names so they can appear on the screen.

The first player begins the game by selecting different choices to accumulate a total that is equivalent to the question.
Then  the first player submits his answer and clicks on the "next question" button.

Now the second player can play.  Once the user clicks on the "next question" button the switch turns function is called.

The switch function changes the boolean values of each player to ensure that the players are switching off to keep track of their scores.

There are 18 questions in all, 9 for each player.  Once we finish all the questions, the screen displays the results as well as the winner!
